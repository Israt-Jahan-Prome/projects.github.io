Object Recognition: A four wheeled robot build in Webots: robot simulator with two distance sensors in the front and a camera on the top. The code is written in python. The robot can detect objects in front of it with the help of sensors and camera and changes its path accordingly by taking turns. Some of the objects such as cylinder, cone, round shapes etc. are made from scratch.  

PID controlled line follower: A four wheeled robot build in Webots: robot simulator which follows a path or line. The path is designed in Autodesk Tinkercad and it consist of multiple turns. The robot has three Infrared sensors in its front which are used to detect the lines in the floor. The code is written in python. PID is also implemented in the robot to calculate the error that is how much the robot gets deviated from the line and it adjusts the position of the robot to bring it back on the track.
